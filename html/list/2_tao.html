<b>Ink and Washi</b><br>
Don't think. What are the most valuable orderings of these words? These letters?
Paragraph after paragraph. Don't think. "Think non-thinking". Poetry? Rain, darkness,
early morning, soon to be November, deep secrets flow gently beneath our feet.
No, not even poetry. The paper speaks all until the ink sticks and then it's already
over. It could've been anything, was everything, now just something. Any decision
is a step from infinite possibility to just this, yet just this is all we will ever have.<br>
