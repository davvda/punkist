Things I think that I think
</h1> 
<p>
- All systems are complex systems.<br>
<br>
- There are no simple systems. There are only simple models
for complex systems.<br>
<br>
- Some complex systems tend to behave in accordance with
simple models.<br>
<br>
- All models are wrong but some are useful or; models are
not reality but some models can facilitate desirable effects
on reality.<br>
<br>
- System thinking is the closest thing to looking at the external
world the same way the Buddha looked at the internal world.<br>
<br>
- Holistic solutions try to encapsulate an entire system with
one or more models whereas reductionistic solutions try to
make partial models of a system as accurate as possible.<br>
<br>
- Both reductionistic and holistic approaches are useful.<br>
<br>
- Holism is generally "eastern" and reductionism is generally
"western".<br>
<br>
- Donella Meadows' list of leverage points seem to fall on a
spectrum with the surface-level interventions being reductionistic
and the deeper interventions being holistic. <br>
<br>
- Once again, both reductionistic and holistic approaches are
useful.<br>
<br>
- Holistic approaches are almost non-existing in the developed
world. We can cure some people of complicated diseases but 
seem unable to keep people truly healthy.<br>
<br>
- Highly developed reductionistic models are crucial for true
progress, but so are highly developed holistic models.<br>
<br>
- As above, so below. As within, so without.<br>
<br>
- Reductionistic models work terribly for the internal world.<br>
<br>
- Consciousness is holistic.<br>
<br>
- Our ability for reductionistic models and inability for holistic
models might answer for the degradation of the "western" soul.<br>
<br>
- Our ability with reductionistic models and inability with holistic
models might answer for why deeper system interventions seem
impossible.<br>
<br>
- Systems at the deepest and most encompassing levels are
inherently unexplainable. God, Zen, Tao...<br>
<br>
- Rationalism and reductionism go hand in hand.<br>
<br>
- Rationalism and holism tend to be enemies because holistic
models will always have gaps in its logic.<br>
<br>
- Rationalism's unwillingness to be irrational means it will never
grasp more than parts of a system.<br>
<br>
- Holistic models reject quantification whereas most reductionistic
model's accuracy are evaluated quantitatively.<br>
<br>
- Holism tends to relate to quality whereas reductionism tends to
relate to quantity.<br>
<br>
- A system doesn't progress, it just changes.<br>
