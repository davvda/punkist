<p><b>Quotes from <a href="https://terebess.hu/zen/mesterek/Zen-Mind.pdf">Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind</a> by Shunryu Suzuki</b></br>
<br>
What we call "I" is just a swinging door which moves when we inhale and when we exhale.
<br>
When you do something, you should do it with your whole body and mind;<br> 
you should be concentrated on what you do. You should do it completely, <br>
like a good bonfire. You should not be a smoky fire. You should burn yourself completely. <br>
If you do not burn yourself completely, a trace of yourself will be left in what you do.<br>
<br>
Try not to force your idea on someone, but rather think about it with them. <br>
If you feel you have won the discussion, that is the wrong attitude. <br>
Try not to win the argument; just listen to it.<br>
<br>
The goal of our lifeâ€™s effort is to reach the other shore, Nirvana. <br>
Prajna paramita, the true wisdom of life, is that in each step of the way, <br>
the other shore is actually reached.<br>
<br>
This is the mystery. When you understand one thing through and through, <br>
you understand everything. When you try to understand everything, <br>
you will not understand anything. The best way is to understand yourself, <br>
and then you will understand everything. So when you try hard to make your own way, <br>
you will help others, and you will be helped by others. <br>
Before you make your own way you cannot help anyone, and no one can help you.<br>
<br>
Those who are attached only to the result of their effort <br>
will not have any chance to appreciate it, because the result will never come.<br>
<br>
Instead of only criticizing your culture, <br>
you should devote your mind and body to practicing this simple way. <br>
Then society and culture will grow out of you.<br>
<br>
It is quite usual for us to gather pieces of information from various sources, <br>
thinking in this way to increase our knowledge. <br>
Actually, following this way we end up not knowing anything at all... <br>
Instead of gathering knowledge, you should clear your mind. <br>
If your mind is clear, true knowledge is already yours.<br>
