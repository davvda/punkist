<title>You contain the enemy</title>
<p>You contain the enemy. Beware of judging, always looking behind your </p>
<p>back for the enemy behind all evil. That seed casting out its first</p>
<p>leaves towards revenge comes from the same plant that has grown</p>
<p>in(to) your so called enemies, always. Its black flowers cover the dead</p>
<p>children of both Jews and Palestinians, it distends the stomachs of the</p>
<p>kwashiorkorous poor and swells the apetite of the unreasonably wealthy.</p>
<p>Look within, or lose all light as the entire world is covered in darkness</p>
<p>fluorishing.
