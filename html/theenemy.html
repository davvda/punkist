<title>You contain the enemy</title>
<p>You contain the enemy. Beware of judging, always looking behind your
back for the enemy behind all evil.<br> That seed casting out its first
leaves towards revenge comes from the same plant that has grown
in(to) your so called enemies, always.<br> Its black flowers cover the dead
children of both Jews and Palestinians, it distends the stomachs of the
kwashiorkorous poor and swells the apetite of the unreasonably wealthy.<br>
Look within, or lose all light as the entire world is covered in darkness
fluorishing.</p>
