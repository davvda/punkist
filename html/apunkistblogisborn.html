<h1>
A Punkist Blog Is Born
</h1> 
<p>The best time to start a blog was five years ago. Actually, it probably wasn't, nor was it ten years ago.
But starting one now is still fine. </p>

<p>It will most likely contain writing related to the same things that over time have ended up on the list.
Or not.</p> 

<p>Blogging is simply an attempt to create a habit and ritual of writing through the reinforcement and
potential punishment of making my writing public. I have for as long as I can remember used writing
to think and capture ideas.</p>
