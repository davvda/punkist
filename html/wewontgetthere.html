<title>We won't get there</title>
<p>We are absolutely flooring it. </p>
<p>The soles of our bloodstained Converse </p>
<p>almost completely worn down to bare feet, </p>
<p>the heat of the pedal soon searing the skin.</p>
<p>We are underage, </p>
<p>under the influence, </p>
<p>Wunderbaum's scent </p>
<p>replaced with burnt rubber. </p> 
<p>We no longer know where we're headed </p>
<p>but we think we've caught up </p>
<p>with the horizon, </p>
<p>high above the clouds. </p>
<p>The infant in the backseat is still asleep. </p> 
<p><i>As long as we're going faster, </i></p> 
<p>we tell ourselves </p> 
<p>with tears or sweat or it doesn't matter </p>
<p>running down our face, </p>
<p><i>we'll get there. </i></p>
