    Coffee Tastings
</h1>
<p>
A fun, educational, and potentieally highly-caffeinated experience
awaits! You will be guided through a coffee tasting consisting of
several different coffees. The tasting is designed to teach you about
coffee in general; where it's grown, how it's processed and roasted,
and how that affects what you prefer. <b>My goal is for you to leave the
tasting with a better understanding and appreciation of the murky
bean juice most of us drink every day and for you to know what you like.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Time:</b> Around 2h
</p>
<p>
<b>Price:</b> 500kr/person
</p>

About me
</h2>
<p>
I have many years of experience working with coffee and
coffee-related things, both in Sweden and Australia. Everything
from being a barista to renovating vintage espresso machines.
Outside of coffee I have a degree in Product Design Engineering 
and most of my career has been in the field of data and AI.

<p>
Coffee tastings can be organised both <b>on location</b> at your office
or <b>remotely</b> depending on where people are located and the coffee samples are then 
sent out to each team member. After the tasting some of the coffees tasted will 
be available for purchase.
