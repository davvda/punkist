<h1>Thoughts on a morally problematic nation</h1>
<p>Sweden is a morally problematic nation. We used to be a super power in the military sense, using force to have our way. Some now see us as a nation of morally superior tolerant people and when something clashes with this view everything suddenly feels very confusing. Should it be? A large part of Swedish welfare is built upon our ability to prosper through the conflict and deaths of other nations. Since before the second world war the Swedish steel industry and consequently our arms export has been one of our main drivers of growth and increasing welfare, now being near the very top of arms exporters per capita in the world. Being surprised and shocked that we suddenly have a political party with its roots in nazism almost winning national elections is, if nothing else, a sign that the story of Sweden as a moral super power is a successful cover-up of our ability to benefit from the efficient killing of other humans.</p>
