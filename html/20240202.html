Things I think that I think 2
</h1>

<p>
- We are at the end of history<br>
<br>
- There is a high probability that we will see a global systemic collapse
in the coming 50 years<br>
<br>
- There is a high probability that this collapse is already happening<br>
<br>
- Business as usual is dead<br>
<br>
- One of the most vital teachings needed is for people to learn how to
fall in love with the world again<br>
<br>
- Our future is not one of progress, it is one of repair, maintenance, 
nurturing, and creation<br>
<br>
- Determinism and free will are irrelevant discussions<br>
<br>
- If you want things to change you shouldn't force it, you should
simply create the conditions for self-organisation and emergence
of the change necessary<br>
<br>
- What you pay attention to is what the world becomes<br>
<br>
- In other words: paying attention is a creative act<br>
