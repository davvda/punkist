<b>5th and 6th of July in Berlin</b><br>
We really love Berlin and it seems Berlin loves us back. Despite a fever and swollen sinuses we've explored Kreuzberg and gathered inspiration as well as a desire to come back here soon for a longer stay in the future.

<b>7th, 8th, and 9th of July in Munich and Innsbruck</b><br>
We left Berlin and headed to Munich. A bit too crowded for Hilma but she had some of the fries from our plant-based currywurst meal by river Isar so she seemed content. Next came the Alps, Tyrol, Innsbruck!<br>

<b>10th of July in Innsbruck</b><br>
I can't recall much because of food poisoning. I think I watched BBC News on the TV while sipping water.<br>
<b>11th of July in Milano and then in Dogliani until the 17th of July</b><br>
Milano was a cosy surprise, especially with Caffè Napoli using a lever machine. Dogliani was too good for this world. We didn't see any other tourists or foreigners in this quaint little town. Incredible.<br>

<b>17th to the 21st of July in Nice</b><br>
Our friend and local buddhist KV joined us from Australia in Nice. He brings the spontaneity.<br>
