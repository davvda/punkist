<h1>Privilege</h1>
<p>Yes, we are privileged. So privileged, in fact, that we have allowed our focus to stray so far into the view of what we want that we are risking a complete indifference to all the things we need. It is, however, vital to remember that the absence of what we want (potentially) leads to dissatisfaction whereas the lack of what we need leads to the death and the ruin of everything we love.</p>
