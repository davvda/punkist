<title>Navel gazing</title>
<h1>Navel gazing</h1>
<p>I am regularly (directly or indirectly) accused of "navel gazing" or focusing too much on the theoretical and philosophical aspects of our world. Contrary to some views, my view is that a change in the fundamental <a href="https://stpeter.im/journal/1737.html">philosophy of living</a> is the most practical change we can possibly spend our time on if we are to have any chance of continuing the process of manifesting our innermost dreams and wishes in the world. When we're not only living unsustainably but in the meantime pondering if whatever way of life we're leading is even worth sustaining my belief is that nothing comes close to the importance of deciding on a direction of progress not measured by useless proxies such as overall economic growth where direction matters little and speed conquers all. </p>
