<title>Attention Creates the World</title>
<h1>Attention Creates the World</h1>
<p>
<b>Attention</b> is not merely a passive act. It is a creative one. What we
choose to pay attention to is what will spring up out of new sources.
What we choose to ignore will wither and die. The dominating culture
of our time is a culture obsessed with doing. If we're not doing something
we're not doing anything. I'm open to the fact that doing nothing might
be the most active thing we can do to change things. Rejecting the
economies of attention to instead <i>attend, tend to, and show tenderness</i>
to the things that are needed, to that which needs our attention more
than ever, that is what truly needs doing. Never before has there been
such urgency to not be urgent. Pay attention.<br>
