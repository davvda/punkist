<title>It doesn't matter much</title>
<h1>It doesn't matter much</h1>
<p>It doesn't matter much<br>
Nothing does<br>
Our time is nothing<br>
to the vast heavens<br>
Yet it is in the vastness<br>
we find ourselves<br>
Is that the way?<br>
I tried telling it all this<br>
today<br>
with feigned indifference<br>
The bridge far away<br>
just stared at me<br>
and the grey sky <br>
heaved a great sigh<br>
<br>
All sages are dead<br>
Buried under a mound<br>
of ancient wisdom<br>
We tried it all<br>
Once, we managed <br>
to dig up a dead cat<br>
Once, we managed <br>
to find a quilted pouch <br>
filled with amaranth<br>
It doesn't matter much<br>
We stopped digging<br>
It cost us too much<br>
Nearly everything<br>
Only my shadow remains<br>
It is said<br>
that it tends a garden there<br>
<br>
You know<br>
I tried following them once<br>
They leave in September<br>
They always do<br>
The swifts, that is<br>
Africa, some said<br>
Beyond the deserts, others said<br>
I laughed <br>
just to blend in<br>
I cried<br>
but few took notice<br>
We kept ascending<br>
I have no memories of<br>
where we landed<br>
if we landed<br>
It doesn't matter much</p><br>
